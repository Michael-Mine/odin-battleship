This is a Javascript project from The Odin Project.

By building from scratch, this will help solidify my recent learning of Test Driven Development (TDD) by Jest.

The unit tests are only for JavaScript objects public interface. The private/internal properties or methods do not need to be tested, as taught by Sandy Metz.

Her talk about this was at Rails Conf 2013 named 'The Magic Tricks of Testing' on YouTube and is also explained in her book 'Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby'.

I also used pure functions for easier testing and loose coupled code which is taught in the Functional Programming paradigm.
